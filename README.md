# FirstTemiApp

This repository documents my learnings in my internship with RoboSolutions. 

Robosolutions Singapore is the exclusive distributor of Temi Robot Singapore. In my time here as an intern, I will be developing Android Applications in Java and Kotlin.

Temi's SDK is available [here](https://github.com/robotemi/sdk/tree/master)

This App will be used to practice implementing different features, hence the features it contain may not come together coherently.
